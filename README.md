👋 Hey there, I'm David Warner II, your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast! 🚀

🏢 Currently rocking the Microsoft Employee life and basking in the glory of being a former Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional). 😎

🏆 Proud winner of the 2019 Microsoft Dev Kitchen, where I cooked up some seriously awesome tech. 🍳

🎤 As a seasoned public speaker, I've been privileged to be on the stages of the Microsoft 365 Conference and the European Power Platform Conference as a keynote speaker. Additionally, I've been honored to speak at numerous domestic and international community events, sharing insights and ideas with tech enthusiasts worldwide. 🌍

💻 When I'm not tinkering with drones or diving into the depths of video development, you'll find me knee-deep in software development trenches. From SharePoint Framework to Power Platform, I'm a huge fan of all things JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages and PowerShell. 💡

🎨 Speaking of creativity, I'm also a graphic design and multimedia fan, wielding Adobe Photoshop, Audition, and After Effects like a digital Picasso. 🎬

🌐 As a proud member of the Microsoft Patterns and Practices Team, I'm all about community engagement. Hosting Microsoft Community Calls, kicking off "Sharing is Caring" initiatives, and championing the "Microsoft Recognition Program" are just a few ways I spread the tech love. 🧡💜

🏈 Oh, did I mention I'm a die-hard Vikings fan? SKOL! 🏒 And when I'm not cheering on my team, you'll catch me enjoying the thrill of hockey or lending my voice over talents to projects for Microsoft, Audible, and more. 🎙️

Let's connect and geek out together! 🤓 💜🧡
